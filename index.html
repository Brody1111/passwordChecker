   /* 
 1. The purpose of this program is to evaluate a input of a password, to see what components are needed to improve it if necessary through a series of functions that
act as tests, with each function regarding a certain aspect needed for a strong password. Then, a output is produced that both shows the strength of the password, and 
what is recommended to improve.  
                   
 2. I used abstraction by splitting my function to find the strength into seperate functions which i could call to find what needed to be fixed. In addition my program was very 
 simple to use, as my textbox uses 'oninput' updating the output every time the text box is updated, making the user friendliness of the program high.
           
 3. I was able to manage complexity by using RepExp in order to check the password if they had contained any of the numbers,
letters or special characters needed. This allowed me to write just one function for each of the different requirements, without using
arrays and loops.
